### Overview

MIT Scratch has been taught at the beginner-level classes at TechDay since its inception. It's extremely easy to use, and does not require downloading any software to your computer (although it is possible to do this to have offline access).

### Logging In
To access Scratch, head over to [scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu). If you attended TechDay, or otherwise already have an account, click on "Sign In" and input your username and password.

### Access Game from TechDay

Once you're logged in, you can either make a new game, or access the Asteroid game that we made during TechDay. This game was made in the CS.100, CS.101, and CS.102 classes. To access the Asteroid game, search "wantaghtechday" in the search bar at the top of your screen.

You should now be at the Wantagh TechDay Scratch account. To recreate the game using the instructions you receievd during your class, click on the "Asteroid Game Template".

Once on the game page, click the "See Inside" button.

Once inside, you should be able to click the remix button to add this game to your account.

Then, just click through the confirmation page, to add a copy of the game to your account.

Then, go back to your profile, and you should see a copy of the game in the "My Stuff" section, as shown below.

Congratulations! You've successfully added a copy of the game to your account. Feel free to change and add more to the game. You can also make a new game, or remix another cool game that you've found using the same instructions. You can also search games just to play them, most of which you can start by clicking the green flag at the top of the game.
